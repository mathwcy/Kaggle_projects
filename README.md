My machine learning projects on Kaggle
---
Welcome ! 👏👏👏

In my school courses, I've gained a solid grasp of various theoretical calculations, algorithms, and applications in statistical learning and machine learning. With this knowledge, I'm looking to apply it to real-world problems through competitions on Kaggle🥇. 
Within this repository, I'll be showcasing some of my machine learning projects.
